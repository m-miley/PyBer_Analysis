# PyBer_Analysis

Resources
- Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook
- Data: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Overview

PyBer is a python-based ride sharing application. This analysis is performed on 4 months of ride sharing data for Q1 of 2019 to glean insights into the profitability and distribution of rides and drivers based on city type categories.  We will look at summary statistics as well as average fares and average driver counts for rural, suburban, and urban cities so that PyBer may make informed decisions.

Furthermore, this analysis presents visualizations using pyplot from the matplotlib library to further describe the statistics and relationships such as a bubble chart for total number of rides, by city per city type, and fare amount whilst also showing driver counts.
This analysis includes research of outliers using box-and-whisker plots, pie charts showing total fare percentages by city type, and a line chart representing a trend on weekly sum aggregations for our 3 city types.  Firstly, however, we will have a look at a summary statistics report highlighting key stats for each city type.

## Results

### Summary Report

As one would expect, Urban cities carry a bulk of the volume when it comes to rides, revenue, and drivers for PyBer seeing how this city type has the most economic activity. Without any knowledge or data on fare rates, we can see that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is lower in Urban settings.  This makes sense seeing how the areas are more compact and distances are likely shorter per ride which would impact both of these fields of measure.  A question we could ask with more data would include mileage per ride and thusly total fare per mile and provide us with a deeper understanding for fare rates by city type.
